# FizzBuzz
I pull this project in when we need a quick mob-programming demonstration of how TDD works. I find FizzBuzz is easy to mob on, especially with non-technical people.

Our FizzBuzz program accepts numbers (positive integers only) and returns either a number or text.
* If the input is divisible by 3, return 'Fizz'.
* If the input is divisible by 5, return 'Buzz'.
* If the input is divisible by 3 and 5, return 'FizzBuzz'.
* Otherwise, return the input number.
